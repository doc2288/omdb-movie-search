# Button and Control Fixes

This document outlines the fixes applied to resolve issues with non-functional buttons and controls in the omdb-movie-search project.

## Issues Identified

### 1. Theme Context Hydration Issues
**Problem:** The ThemeContext was accessing localStorage directly during server-side rendering, causing hydration mismatches that could prevent client-side JavaScript from working properly.

**Solution:**
- Added proper client-side only initialization
- Implemented hydration state tracking with `isHydrated` flag
- Added error handling for localStorage access
- Improved system theme detection and preference handling

### 2. SearchBar Event Handling
**Problem:** Event handlers were not properly optimized and could cause performance issues or unexpected behavior.

**Solution:**
- Implemented `useCallback` hooks for all event handlers
- Added proper form reference handling with `useRef`
- Improved disabled states for loading scenarios
- Enhanced accessibility with proper focus management
- Fixed button click events with explicit preventDefault and stopPropagation

### 3. MovieCard Interaction Issues
**Problem:** Click handlers were not properly structured and could interfere with each other.

**Solution:**
- Separated IMDb link functionality into dedicated button elements
- Added proper keyboard navigation support
- Implemented loading states for asynchronous operations
- Enhanced accessibility with ARIA labels and proper button semantics
- Fixed event propagation issues

### 4. ThemeToggle Component
**Problem:** The theme toggle might not work correctly due to hydration issues.

**Solution:**
- Added loading state during hydration
- Improved visual feedback with better animations
- Enhanced accessibility with proper ARIA attributes
- Added proper disabled state handling

## Technical Improvements

### Performance Optimizations
- Used `useCallback` hooks to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Implemented proper memoization for expensive operations
- Added loading states to improve user experience

### Accessibility Enhancements
- Added proper ARIA labels and roles

### Error Handling
- Added try-catch blocks for localStorage operations
- Implemented graceful fallbacks for failed operations

### Browser Compatibility
- Fixed SSR/client-side hydration issues
- Ensured proper localStorage feature detection
- Added fallbacks for older browsers
